// Q.) Write A Program to display the table of S and show it an array in C language.

#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
    int s[10]= {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
    
    for(int i=0; i<10; i++) {
        printf("%d*%d= %d\n", s[i], i+1, s[i]*(i+1));
    }
    printf("\n The table of S in an array is :");
    for(int i=0; i<10; i++) {
        printf("%d", s[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}

// This line includes the stdio.h header file, which contains declarations for standard input/output functions.

line declares the main() function, which is the entry point for all C programs.

line declares an array named s of size 10 and initializes it with the values 1, 2, 3, ..., 10.

This for loop iterates from 0 to 9 and prints the table of S to the console. The printf() function prints the following output for each iteration of the loop.

For example, the first iteration of the loop will print the following output:

1 * 1 = 1
The second iteration of the loop will print the following output:

2 * 2 = 4

 printf("\n The table of S in an array is :");
  for(int i=0; i<10; i++) {
    printf("%d", s[i]);
  }
  printf("\n");


This code prints the table of S stored in the s array to the console.

 return 0;

This line returns 0 from the main() function, which indicates that the program terminated successfully.
